## Philosophy

Every guide in this section follows the same principles:

- **Use-case first** — Organized by what you're trying to do, not by tool name
- **Honest assessments** — Strengths, limitations, and when to use each tool
- **Actionable** — You should be able to pick a tool and start using it immediately
- **Up to date** — Tools evolve fast; we keep these current
