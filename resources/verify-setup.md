# Verify My Setup

> Check if Git, Node.js, and Python are configured correctly

## Cursor Prompt

Copy and paste this prompt into Cursor:

```
Hey! I want to make sure my development environment is set up correctly in Cursor. I'm not very technical, so please explain everything simply.

Please check the following and tell me if each one is good or needs fixing:

1. **Git installed?** Run `git --version`

2. **Git identity configured?** Run `git config --global user.name` and `git config --global user.email`
   - If these are empty, ask me for my name and email, then set them for me

3. **Node.js installed?** (optional but common) Run `node --version`

4. **Python installed?** (optional but common) Run `python3 --version` or `python --version`

At the end, give me a simple summary:
- What's working
- What's missing or needs setup
- For anything missing, offer to help me install it

Explain everything in plain English. Don't assume I know what any technical terms mean.
```
