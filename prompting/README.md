## Why Separate by Provider?

Different AI providers have different:
- API structures and parameters
- Model capabilities and limitations
- Best practices and recommendations
- Pricing and optimization strategies

Provider-specific guides ensure you get the most accurate, actionable information for the models you're actually using.
